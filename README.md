# First-year C++ project on building application using QT framework.
### Defense branch includes additional application tasks from the checker.

## Overview
The project was that I randomly got a project specification from another person and on it I had to implement it and make a report on the work. 
In my project I needed to implement an application in QT Creator that works with a csv file. The application had to modify, add and delete data from the table, show the logo and allow me to download the modified csv file. Also ,the author of the idea of my project proposed various additional tasks such as a window with the details of the project development, a window with a detailed description of the film, etc.
